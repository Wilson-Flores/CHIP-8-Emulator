# CHIP-8-Emulator

As a personal project, I am building a CHIP-8 emulator using C++ and following Austin Morlan's guide, "Building a CHIP-8 Emulator [C++]." The aim of this project is to learn the process of creating an emulator from scratch, and to gain experience in working with low-level programming concepts such as memory management, instruction set architecture, and graphics rendering.

## <span style="font-size: smaller;">Motivation</span>

I decided to work on this project because I wanted to challenge myself with a low-level programming task and learn about computer systems at a deeper level. By building an emulator, I can gain insight into how processors work, how memory is managed, and how software interacts with hardware.

## <span style="font-size: smaller;">Features</span>

My CHIP-8 emulator currently supports the following features:

- Loading and running CHIP-8 ROMs.
- Emulating the CHIP-8 CPU instructions and system memory.
- Handling input from a keyboard and mapping it to the CHIP-8 keypad.
- Rendering graphics on a simple screen using SDL2 library.
- Supporting sound playback for CHIP-8 sound effects.
